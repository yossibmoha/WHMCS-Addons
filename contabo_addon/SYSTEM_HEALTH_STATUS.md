<title>Your Company Status - System Health</title>
<h1>Your Company Status</h1>

// Custom colors and styling
$statusColors = [
    'operational' => '#your-green-color',
    'major_outage' => '#your-red-color',
    // ... customize colors
];
```

### ⚙️ **Configuration Options**

```php
// Refresh interval (seconds)
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="60">

// Cache duration for performance
$cacheTime = 300; // 5 minutes

// Services to monitor
$services = [
    'vps_management' => 'VPS Management',
    'contabo_api' => 'Contabo API',
    // ... add/remove services
];
```

### 🔧 **Health Check Customization**

Modify health check logic in `SystemHealthService.php`:

```php
private function checkVPSManagementHealth()
{
    // Custom health check logic
    $threshold = 10; // Error threshold
    $timeframe = '-1 hour'; // Check period
    
    // Your custom monitoring logic
}
```

---

## Performance & Scaling

### ⚡ **Caching Strategy**

The system implements intelligent caching:
- **Client Area**: 5-minute cache to avoid performance impact
- **Public Page**: Real-time updates with 60-second refresh
- **Admin Dashboard**: Live data with 30-second auto-refresh

### 📈 **Performance Optimization**

- Lightweight database queries with proper indexing
- Minimal resource usage for health checks
- Asynchronous status updates
- CDN-friendly static assets

### 🔄 **Auto-Refresh System**

- **Public Page**: Automatically refreshes every 60 seconds
- **Admin Dashboard**: Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds  
- **Client Area**: Cache-based updates every 5 minutes
- **Graceful degradation**: Falls back if auto-refresh fails

## Best Practices

### 📝 **Incident Communication**

**✅ Do:**
- Use clear, non-technical language
- Provide regular updates every 30-60 minutes
- Include estimated resolution times
- Acknowledge customer impact
- Post resolution confirmations

**❌ Don't:**
- Use technical jargon customers won't understand
- Leave incidents without updates for hours
- Minimize or downplay service impact
- Forget to mark incidents as resolved

### 🕒 **Maintenance Windows**

**✅ Best Times:**
- Schedule during low-traffic periods
- Provide 24-48 hours advance notice
- Clearly communicate expected duration
- List affected services specifically

**✅ Communication:**
- Post maintenance notices prominently
- Send email notifications to customers
- Update status page with maintenance details
- Provide alternative contact methods during outages

### 📊 **Monitoring Strategy**

**✅ Regular Checks:**
- Monitor health checks every 5-10 minutes
- Review error logs daily
- Analyze performance trends weekly
- Update incident procedures monthly

---

## Troubleshooting

### 🚨 **Common Issues**

**Status Page Not Loading**
```bash
# Check file permissions
chmod 644 public_status.php

# Verify database connectivity
# Check mod_contabo_incidents table exists
```

**Health Checks Failing**
```php
// Enable debug logging in SystemHealthService.php
$this->logHelper->log('health_check_debug', [
    'service' => $serviceKey,
    'result' => $result,
    'timestamp' => date('Y-m-d H:i:s')
]);
```

**Performance Issues**
```php
// Increase cache duration
$cacheTime = 600; // 10 minutes instead of 5

// Reduce health check frequency
$healthCheckInterval = 300; // 5 minutes instead of 1 minute
```

### 🔧 **Database Maintenance**

```sql
-- Clean up old incident data (older than 90 days)
DELETE FROM mod_contabo_incidents 
WHERE created_at < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 90 DAY) 
AND status = 'resolved';

-- Clean up old health check records (older than 7 days)  
DELETE FROM mod_contabo_load_balancer_health_checks 
WHERE checked_at < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 7 DAY);
```
